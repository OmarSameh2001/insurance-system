# Insurance System
This project is the backend of an insurance system designed to perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations necessary for managing insurance policies, customers, brokers, and connecting them with different primary and foreign keys. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, and it will soon be connected to a React frontend.

## Key Features:
Policy Management: Create, read, update, and delete insurance policies.

Customer Management: Handle customer data and operations including registration, profile updates, and account deletion.

Broker Management: Manage broker information and operations.

Authentication & Authorization: Secure endpoints with user authentication and role-based access control.

Database Integration: Connects to a MongoDB database for persistent data storage.

RESTful API: Provides a set of RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations.


## Technology Stack:
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.

Express: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing insurance data.

Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

JWT: JSON Web Tokens for securing API endpoints.

bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords.
